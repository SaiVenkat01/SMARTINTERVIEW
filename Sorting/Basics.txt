An algorithm which takes space complexity 1,then
those algorithm are known as inplace algorithms.

1.BubbleSort   n2,1
2.SelectionSort  n2,1
3.InsertionSort  n2,1
4.CountSort      n+range,range
5.MergeSort     nlogn,n 
Internally(in brain) we use SelectionSort
-----4.CountSort-----
Limitations:
1)If range is large
When we shouldn't use CountSort is that
when the ranse is way bigger than the number of elements
Ideal case to use count sort is r<=n
